## What is SmartSysOps Toolkit?

SmartSysOps Toolkit is an all-in-one command-line powerhouse for Windows. Instead of juggling multiple tools, scripts, and apps — you get **everything in one terminal**:

- Ask AI to write code and run it instantly
- Control your system (volume, brightness, WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Monitor CPU, RAM, network speed in real time
- Manage files with 20+ file commands
- Track habits, take notes, set reminders
- Encrypt files, scan ports, test APIs
- Have fun with Matrix rain, morse code, QR codes and more

All file operations are **sandboxed to D:\ drive** — nothing can touch your system files.
